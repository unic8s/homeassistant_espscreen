"""Write the two entry files of every board in boards.yaml: packages/<key>.yaml and checkout/<key>.yaml.

A screen is built from an entry that includes the shared core and one board file (docs/PROFILES.md):

- packages/<key>.yaml is what a screen installed from ESP Screens builds from over GitHub. ESP Screen Manager writes
  every screen's own YAML with `files: [packages/<key>.yaml]`, so these names never change and their content is a
  promise to every screen out there: the fonts and the components from GitHub, nothing of the screen's own.
- checkout/<key>.yaml builds the same two files from a clone of this repository (checkout/README.md): the fonts and
  components of the checkout, the secrets from checkout/secrets.yaml.

The two differ between boards only in the board file they include and the components that board needs besides
smart_display: a component of this repository its hardware names as a platform (the CYD's xpt2046 touch panel). So
they are written from the catalog instead of by hand, and `--check` (tools/check.sh) fails when one is out of date.

    python3 tools/generate_entries.py            # write every board's two entries
    python3 tools/generate_entries.py --check    # fail when one differs from what this would write
